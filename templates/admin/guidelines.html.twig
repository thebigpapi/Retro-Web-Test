## Motherboards

#### Adding a board

Adding a motherboard to the database can be done with the built-in editor. InÂ [Admin/Motherboards](https://theretroweb.com/admin/manage/motherboards?entity=motherboard), click *Add motherboard*.
A rather long form will appear; let's run over the fields.

1. #### Manufacturer

Here you are provided with a list of pre-defined manufacturers (this list can be edited [here](https://theretroweb.com/admin/manage/miscs?entity=manufacturer)), from which you can select the manufacturer of the board.  
Leaving this field empty will select the manufacturer as "Unknown".  
*Example: ASUS, Gigabyte, HP, Acer, etc.*

2. #### Name

In this field you are supposed to type in the part number that you see on the board silkscreen or manual cover. This field is mandatory.  
*Example: GA-686BX (rev 1.0), Advanced/EV (Endeavor), M919, K7S41GX, etc.*

3. #### Slug

This field is used to generate a friendly URL for the board you're adding. This field is mandatory.  
*Example: for a board named ASUS P2B-D2 (REV. 1.02) => asus-p2b-d2-rev.-1.02*

4. #### Images

This field lets you add images by clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ]. A new item is generated, where 
you can select the file to be uploaded, the owner of the image, the type of the image (schema: board schematics/jumper layouts) and/or add notes.

5. #### Alternative names (or aliases)
Here you can add multiple names for the board, if it has been sold in the past by multiple vendors, like ECS/PCchips/Amptron. 
Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new manufacturer and a name field, like at 1. and 2.  

6. #### Redirections
Here you can add redirection IDs for old boards in TRW which have been deleted or TH99 boards which haven't been added yet.
Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you two fields, one to select the redirect type, and one to input the ID.  
To access boards using the TH99 ID, replace the URL as follows: ``https://theretroweb.com/th99/m/[insert TH99 ID here]``
To access boards using the old UR ID, replace the URL as follows: ``https://theretroweb.com/motherboards/[insert UR ID here]``

7. #### PSU connectors
Here you are provided with a list of pre-defined PSU connectors. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new field.

8. #### Form factor
Here you can select the shape standard of the board (ATX, Baby AT, LPX, etc.). If unsure, leave empty.

9. #### Chipset
Here you can select the chipset of the motherboard from a pre-defined list. If unsure, leave empty.

10. #### Dimensions
Here you can type in the physical dimensions of the board. Height x width in mm is preferred. If unsure, leave empty.

11. #### Video/Audio chipset
Here you can select the video/audio chipset of the motherboard from a pre-defined list. If unsure, leave empty.

12. #### Max video ram
This field is tied to the video chipset and should be left empty if unsure.

13. #### Max system ram
Here you can add the max amount of memory the motherboard can make use of. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you two new fields, 
one to select the memory size, and a text field to write a note if necesary (say, if one limit is for EDO and the other is for SDRAM).

14. #### Cache
Here you can add the amount of cache memory the motherboard supports. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new field to select the amount of cache to add.

15. #### Supported RAM types
Here you can select the memory types the motherboard supports.
