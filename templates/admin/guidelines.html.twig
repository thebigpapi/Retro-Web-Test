## Motherboards

#### Adding a board

Adding a motherboard to the database can be done with the built-in editor. InÂ [Admin/Motherboards](https://theretroweb.com/admin/manage/motherboards?entity=motherboard), click *Add motherboard*.
A rather long form will appear; let's run over the fields.
You can access three different sections in the board editor as follows (the rest are always visible):
* Description: for items 5. -> 19.
* Downloads: for items 20. -> 22.
* CPUs: for items 23. -> 28.

1. #### Manufacturer

Here you are provided with a list of pre-defined manufacturers (this list can be edited [here](https://theretroweb.com/admin/manage/miscs?entity=manufacturer)), from which you can select the manufacturer of the board.  
Leaving this field empty will select the manufacturer as "Unknown".  
*Example: ASUS, Gigabyte, HP, Acer, etc.*

2. #### Name

In this field you are supposed to type in the part number that you see on the board silkscreen or manual cover. This field is mandatory.  
*Example: GA-686BX (rev 1.0), Advanced/EV (Endeavor), M919, K7S41GX, etc.*

3. #### Slug

This field is used to generate a friendly URL for the board you're adding. This field is mandatory.   
Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/edit.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Get slug* ] will generate a slug automagically, based on the contents of 1. and 2.

4. #### Images

This field lets you add images by clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ]. A new item is generated, where 
you can select the file to be uploaded, the owner of the image, the type of the image (schema: board schematics/jumper layouts) and/or add notes.

5. #### Alternative names (or aliases)
Here you can add multiple names for the board, if it has been sold in the past by multiple vendors, like ECS/PCchips/Amptron. 
Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new manufacturer and a name field, like at 1. and 2.  

6. #### Redirections
Here you can add redirection IDs for old boards in TRW which have been deleted or TH99 boards which haven't been added yet.
Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you two fields, one to select the redirect type, and one to input the ID.  
To access boards using the TH99 ID, replace the URL as follows: ``https://theretroweb.com/th99/m/[insert TH99 ID here]``
To access boards using the old UR ID, replace the URL as follows: ``https://theretroweb.com/motherboards/[insert UR ID here]``

7. #### PSU connectors
Here you are provided with a list of pre-defined PSU connectors. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new field.

8. #### Form factor
Here you can select the shape standard of the board (ATX, Baby AT, LPX, etc.). If unsure, leave empty.

9. #### Chipset
Here you can select the chipset of the motherboard from a pre-defined list. If unsure, leave empty.

10. #### Dimensions
Here you can type in the physical dimensions of the board. Height x width in mm is preferred. If unsure, leave empty.

11. #### Video/Audio chipset
Here you can select the video/audio chipset of the motherboard from a pre-defined list. If unsure, leave empty.

12. #### Max video ram
This field is tied to the video chipset and should be left empty if unsure.

13. #### Max system ram
Here you can add the max amount of memory the motherboard can make use of. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you two new fields, 
one to select the memory size, and a text field to write a note if necesary (say, if one limit is for EDO and the other is for SDRAM).

14. #### Cache
Here you can add the amount of cache memory the motherboard supports. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new field to select the amount of cache to add.

15. #### Supported RAM types
Here you can select the memory types the motherboard supports.

16. #### I/O ports
Here you can add I/O ports to the motherboard. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you two new fields, one for
the amount of ports and the other for the port type.

17. #### Expansion slots
Here you can add expansion slots to the motherboard. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you two new fields, one for
the amount of slots and the other for the slot type.

18. #### Known issues
Here you can add known issues to the motherboard. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new field for
the known issue you want to add.

19. #### Notes
Here you can add notes to the motherboard. This field uses markdown text.

20. #### Drivers
Here you can add drivers to the motherboard from a pre-defined list. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you two new fields, one for
the driver you want to add, and the other is a checkbox which prioritizes the driver visibility on the board page.

21. #### BIOS images
Here you can add BIOS images to the motherboard. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a bunch of new fields for (in order): 
BIOS manufacturer, POST string, core version, bios version, file upload section and uploaded file view.

22. #### Manuals

the CPU socket you want to add.

24. #### CPU platforms
Here you can add CPU platforms to the motherboard. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new field for
the CPU platform you want to add.

25. #### FSB speeds
Here you can add FSB speeds to the motherboard. Clicking [<img src="{{ absolute_url(asset('build/icons/add.svg')) }}" alt="" width="16" style="vertical-align: middle;">*Add* ] will give you a new field for
the FSB speed you want to add.

26. #### Max CPUs
Here you can add the maximum amount of CPUs supported by the motherboard (mainly used by SMP capable boards like dual socket 370 for e.g.).

27. #### CPUs
In this section you can add and/or remove CPUs to/from the board. In order to use this section properly, you must first fill in all the appropriate details in fields 21. 22. and 23., then click the [*Update processors*] button, 
after which you can add CPUs.

28. #### NPUs
In this section you can add and/or remove math coprocessors to/from the board. The procedures are identical with the CPU section.
