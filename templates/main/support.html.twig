		We are a small scale operation, completely homebrew. We're building this website to help people like you finding
		information and resources that would be otherwise hard to find on the Internet. Consider it more like a fun
		side-project.

		This is the reason we decided not to profit on this website, yet. If you decide to donate, be aware that we're
		not putting your money straight in our pockets, but it all goes to paying bills for keeping this place alive
		(namely, hosting space and domain). If we'll ever consider splitting some of the revenue among authors and
		contributors, we'll let you know.

		If you like our website, we would greatly appreciate your financial help for keeping it online and in working order.
